what's happening here?

<p style="text-align: left;">Being able to write is good. I want to get better at it and quite obviously the best way to get better is to write! However my desire to get better at writing is strongly overshadowed by my reluctance to write useless things, the internet is already so full of meaningless crap (at best and harmful crap at worst), and I'd hate to be one adding to it.</p><p style="text-align: left;">The only avenues where I'm capable of writing non-trivial stuff in are math and computer science, but triviality is a matter of perspective and anything I'd be writing about would already be written about considerably better than me by people who consider it trivial. The only way past seems to be to write about the one problem that I managed to come up with and this post is about that problem , it's solution and further generalizations of it</p><h2 style="text-align: left;">Next / Previous Video</h2><p style="text-align: left;">You're probably familiar with the next/previous function of a video players which opens the appropriate video file (most of the time alphabetically) coming after/before the current video. you may also be familiar with the <b>Recent </b>section that is shown when you right click on the video player in the taskbar listing around <br />the 10 most recent files that have been opened by the video player

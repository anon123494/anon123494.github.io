<br />if there has even been any proverb that I keep coming back to , it would be this:<h3 style="text-align: center;">"هرکه بامش بیش برفش بیشتر"</h3><p style="text-align: left;">so I thought it would be a good idea (and also exercise) to bring you guys its meaning (even though it's very similar to a very famous pop culture quote , as we'll see!)<br />a direct translation of the proverb to English would be "whoever has the biggest roof , gets the biggest snow"</p><div style="text-align: left;">and this already gives us a hint for it's meaning. it's obvious that the people who have bigger roofs -thus bigger houses and a bigger fortune- get more snow on it and have to spend a longer time&nbsp; clearing it -more work and responsibility as a result of that fortune-</div><p style="text-align: left;">so it's basically that uncle ben quote in the original spider man :</p><h4 style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;"with great power comes great responsibility"</h4><p style="text-align: left;">but there's another way to view this proverb which sticks with me and its that this responsibility isn't merely something you're morally obliged to carry out but something that has its own weight and cost.<br />that fortune and power themselves put an unavoidable burden on you that will take its toll even if you don't carry out your responsibilities<br />the mere knowledge that you have this fortune , that you can use it to help others will either demand constant attention and exhausting work or take from you your care and worry for others and leave in its stead a selfish apathetic self</p><div style="text-align: left;"><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div><div><br /></div>
